# Paper Trail (iPad Pro implementation)

Paper Trail is a marker-based AR authoring tool for enhancing paper-based instructional materials with varrious forms of digital media, animations for dynamic illustrations, and clipping masks to guide students' learning. We created Paper Trail as a part of our CHI 2022 publication:

*Paper Trail: An Immersive Authoring System for Augmented Reality Instructional Experiences.* Shwetha Rajaram & Michael Nebeling. CHI 2022.

<h2>Unity Scenes</h2>

**TorqueHandout:** this sample scene is a representative example of all of Paper Trail's AR features. We used the Torque Handout as an example in our user studies with PhD student instructors, XR design experts, and high school instructors. You can download the torque handout [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C4VrJB96g7f7sYV6IEmOKhddrwqSrj5oew87MeDrkCk/edit?usp=sharing)!

**PaperTrail** this is the version of Paper Trail we used in our final user study with high school instructors. The Vuforia Image Targets hardcoded in the scene are the same markers used in the Torque Handout (see above).

**PaperTrail-Startup:** this is a landing screen with buttons to navigate to the *TorqueHandout* and *PaperTrail* scenes.

We recommend you build all 3 scenes in Unity, with *PaperTrail-Startup* as the first scene.
